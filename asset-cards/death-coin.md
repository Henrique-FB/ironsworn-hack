The members of your covenant trade in Death Coins. You start the game with 3.

- When you Compel by giving someone powerful a Death Coin, count it as a strong hit.
- When you Resupply on one of your Covenant’s bases, you can choose to regain 1 Death Coin instead of the other options.
- You may spend 1 Death Coin at one of your covenant’s bases to grab an Item asset for some time. Deliver it back on proper time or Pay the Price.
