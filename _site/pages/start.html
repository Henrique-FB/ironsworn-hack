  <li><strong>It’s a gritty setting.</strong> People are oppressed by both other people and the harsh world around them.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s a bleak setting.</strong> Moments of coziness and happyness are few and far between.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s a hopeful setting.</strong> Even through the harshness of the world, the small moments of warmth fill the people with hope. Enough to fight for a better future.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s a grey setting.</strong> Most people are fighting for their survival and their own goals.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s <em>not</em> a lonely setting.</strong> People form communities to survive. Families; Kingdoms; Guilds; Churches. Everyone knows someone else that can do the job they can’t.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s <em>not</em> a highly technological setting.</strong> Technology may exist in the form of steam powdered metal machinery, trains, funcional prosthetics, but it is either scarse, expensive, or extremely dangerous.</li>
