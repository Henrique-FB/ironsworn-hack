Long metal chains that were once bathed in a pool of Arcana.
- If you manage to tie your chains around a foe in battle, as long as you remain in control, add +1 to every move, and gain +1 momentum on every hit.
- When your chains touch a mundane being, you may choose to curse them with Arcana. If you do so, Mark Progress twice and <ins>Pay the Price</ins>. Envision how their anatomy changes because of the bizarre power of the Arcana.
- When you <ins>Canâ€™t Hold the Arcana Back</ins>, instead of one of the options on the move, you may wrap your chains around your body. As long as they remain tied to you, they hold the Arcana back for you.
**Do Not Remove Them**.
