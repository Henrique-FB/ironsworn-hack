# Arcana

> If you want more media like this game, or you want to familiarize yourself with the fiction displayed here, I give you a somewhat extensive list of media I know that brushes on the ideas I presented.

## Movies
- **Jumper** - Villain of the movie captures the essence of "fighting against a superpowered person" very well


## Manga
- **Berserk** - Angry Dude vs God


## Anime
- **Hai to Gensou no Grimgar** - Fantasy low magic "Weak dudes fight weak monsters*.
- **Megalobox** - Steampunkish "Underdog fights without tech". 
- **Hellsing Ultimate** - Immaculate vibes.
- **Rokka no Yuusha** - "Dude uses tricks to beat people that use magic".

## Books
- **Steelheart** - Again not wizards nor medieval but idea stands. No powers vs Superpowers.


## Web Novels
- **Pale** - Girls way over their heads interact with the fae. Every scene with John Stiles in it is exactly what this game is going for.


## Games
- **Bloodborne** - Bleak setting where you hunt monsters. Need I say more.
- **S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly** - You have guns, you suck at the game, the game has monsters, the monsters don't suck at the game.

## TTRPGs
- **Ironsworn** - I mean.. yeah.
- **Dungeon World** - With the right combination of playbooks (Fighter, Thief, Ranger, or some custom ones) you can get very close to this idea of "underpowered heroes fight monsters/wizards/etc"
- [**Bloodstone**](https://matteosciutteri.itch.io/bloodstone) - Fantastic design. Very much what I would be going for if I was any good at this.


## Short Stories
- [**For Those Who Have Fallen**](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/pantheon-color-story/) - The entire idea of despising wizards of the game comes from this character's hatred of Gods.
