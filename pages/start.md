## Default Assumptions
- **It's a gritty setting.** People are oppressed by both other people and the harsh world around them.
- **It's a bleak setting.** Moments of coziness and happyness are few and far between.
- **It's a hopeful setting.** Even through the harshness of the world, the small moments of warmth fill the people with hope. Enough to fight for a better future.
- **It's a grey setting.** Most people are fighting for their survival and their own goals. 
- **It's _not_ a lonely setting.** People form communities to survive. Families; Kingdoms; Guilds; Churches. Everyone knows someone else that can do the job they can't.
- **It's _not_ a highly technological setting.** Technology may exist in the form of steam powdered metal machinery, trains, funcional prosthetics, but it is either scarse, expensive, or extremely dangerous.
