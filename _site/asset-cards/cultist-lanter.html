    <p>Whenever you spend more than a few minutes by the light of the Lantern, take -1 fuel. Whenever a human dies near the lantern, take +1 fuel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you <ins>Heal</ins> by basking yourself in the light of the Lantern, roll+fuel. You may sacrifice fuel instead of resources when healing in this manner.</li>
  <li>When you <ins>Endure Harm</ins> while fighting lit only by the faint glow of the Lantern, Mark Progress equal to the amount of harm endured. Additionally, if you choose to <em>Embrace the Pain</em> while rolling to resist harm, take +2 momentum (instead of +1).</li>
  <li>When your Lantern is full of fuel and would gain more, it instead burns hotter and brighter. Take +2 momentum.</li>
</ul>
