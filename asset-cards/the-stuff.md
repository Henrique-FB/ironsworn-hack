You have a set of needles. For the cravings.

- When you <ins>Secure an Advantage</ins> by injecting yourself with some of the stuff,the choices on a hit instead become:
    - Take +3 momentum
    - Gain +2 on your next move (not a progress move).
- When you <ins>Make a Connection</ins> by sharing some of your stuff with someone else, it’s always a weak hit.
- When you <ins>Strike</ins> by injecting the stuff in a being with arcana running wild through their veins, don’t roll. Instead Mark Progress twice and <ins>Pay the Price</ins>. Envision how the stuff interacts with their arcane essence to make them terrifying.
