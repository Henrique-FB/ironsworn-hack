   <p>Important Game Concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starforged medieval-ish hack.</li>
  <li>In this game you play a Wizard Hunter. You are part of a Covenant, a group dedicated to hunting wizards. Wizards are awful, sickening, vile fucking parasites.</li>
  <li>Your covenant has a domain (a circle on the map that denotes its sphere of influence). Wizards also have domains (called ‘demesne’ in the rules)</li>
  <li>There are now “Item” and “Estate” assets. Item assets represent significant items you can obtain. Estate assets represent important descriptors and tools your entire covenant has access to. When your character dies these assets generally continue in play.</li>
  <li>The game play loop involves your character hunting wizards, likely killing some, and later discovering their own wizardly nature and becoming a wizard themselves. After which you will lose control of the character, make another wizard hunter character using the <ins>Continue a Legacy</ins> move (which will be much more commonly used in this hack than it is in the main game), rinse repeat.</li>
  <li>Text crossed out will is meant to show your character’s denial of their wizardly nature.</li>
  <li>Arcana is a term ment to represent magical energy in general. In a spell, in the air, in someone’s body, w/e.</li>
  <li>When playing solo, your character is always secretly a soon-to-become wizard. When playing co-op one of the players may opt to be only a normal human.</li>
  <li>More rules will be properly laid out later in other pages.</li>
</ul>
