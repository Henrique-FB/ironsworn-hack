    <p>Within your covenant’s domain, you are the law.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your covenant has an army that acts within its domain. Create a connection with someone in this army. You may call upon your connection to annihilate someone within the covenant’s domain. This counts as <ins>Testing your Relationship</ins>, and on a hit you do not Develop your Relationship.</li>
  <li>When you <ins>Gather Information</ins> or <ins>Compel</ins> by flashing your covenant’s credentials (a tattoo, a ring…), add +1 and gain +1 momentum on a hit.</li>
  <li>When you intimidate someone into <ins>Making a Connection</ins> with you, you may roll +iron instead of +heart, if you do so make their rank 1 higher than what you first envisioned. When you <ins>Develop your Relationship</ins> with this connection, take +1 momentum.</li>
</ul>
