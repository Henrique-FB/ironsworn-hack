    <p>You have a set of needles. For the cravings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you <ins>Secure an Advantage</ins> by injecting yourself with some of the stuff,the choices on a hit instead become:
    <ul>
      <li>Take +3 momentum</li>
      <li>Gain +2 on your next move (not a progress move).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you <ins>Make a Connection</ins> by sharing some of your stuff with someone else, it’s always a weak hit.</li>
  <li>When you <ins>Strike</ins> by injecting the stuff in a being with arcana running wild through their veins, don’t roll. Instead Mark Progress twice and <ins>Pay the Price</ins>. Envision how the stuff interacts with their arcane essence to make them terrifying.</li>
</ul>
