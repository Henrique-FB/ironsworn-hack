You have an uncanny ability to feel Arcana.

- When you <ins>Undertake an Expedition</ins> towards a source of magic, get +1. On a Strong Hit also gain +1 momentum.
- When you <ins>Gather Information</ins> by letting ~~out~~ Arcana through your body, add +2. Describe how the Arcana twists your view, and on a hit describe how you see through it.
- When you <ins>React Under Fire</ins> or <ins>Clash</ins> and get a miss, you may choose to treat it as a weak hit. Describe how ~~your energy~~ … ~~your magic~~ … ~~YOUR ARCANA SAVES YOU~~ … the situation turns in your favor. ~~Mark a tick on your Arcana Track.~~
