Your sword is finely made by Shin, the legendary swordsmith.

- When you <ins>Strike</ins> using your blade you may choose to forgo your stat bonus for the roll. If you do so, on a hit, mark progress thrice (instead of just twice).
- When you <ins>Sojourn</ins>, people recognize your blade, add +the amount of points on this asset.
- When you <ins>Battle</ins>, treat a miss as a weak hit and a weak hit as a strong hit.
